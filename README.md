Fearsome
==

A library for analyzing board games, finding optimal strategies, and building a better
understanding of the mathematics behind the games of our childhood.

The first iteration implements the game Connect Four, and attempts to act as a querying
tool to quickly answer questions about the game through automated simulations. The goal
is for anyone with a few minutes to learn the library to answer questions like the
following:

- Does the first player have an advantage over the second player?
- How large is the resulting "player order" edge?
- How much of the outcome of the game is determined by strategy as opposed to chance?
- Is there an optimal strategy?
- What is the optimal strategy?
- If a player using optimal strategy were to play against a player using random moves,
how often would he lose (i.e. 1 in 10 games, 1 in 100 games, 1 in 1,000 games, 1 in 1,000,000
games, etc.)?
